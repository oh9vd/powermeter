#Hardware for power meter

**Note** : This is old documentation of the boards that has gone trough many changes since. 
Please consider this as start point of your own hardware design and should be used only if you are willing to do so.
This document will stay in place for the time being until I have a better idea how to set up the boards with proper power meter functionality.
I am not going to implement this as it is too much work that would need more than one person to complete and there is no guarantee that all of us can do so.
If you are interested in hardware design for power meter, I will be glad to help with the implementation.
