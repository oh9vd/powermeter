# Powermeter firmware

## Overview

This project is built using PlatformIO, an open-source ecosystem for IoT development. It supports multiple boards and frameworks.

├── test/                    # Unit tests
├── platformio.ini           # Project configuration file
```

## Prerequisites

- **PlatformIO Core**: Make sure you have PlatformIO Core installed. You can install it from the [official website](https://platformio.org/install).
- **IDE**: While not mandatory, using an IDE like VSCode with PlatformIO extension can ease development.

## Configuration

PlatformIO projects are configured using the `platformio.ini` file. Here is the configuration:

```ini
[env:nanoatmega328]
platform = atmelavr
board = nanoatmega328
framework = arduino

upload_protocol = arduino
upload_speed = 57600
upload_port=$UPLOAD_PORT
monitor_port=COM7 # change this to your platform configuration
monitor_speed = 57600

lib_deps =
  ltc230x
  encoder @^1.4.0
  freqcount@^1.0.0
  adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library@^1.10.13
  adafruit/Adafruit SSD1306@^2.5.0
  ArduinoJson@^6.21.5
```

## Getting Started

### Build and Upload

To build and upload the project to your board, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

### Monitor Serial Output

To monitor the serial output from your device, use:

```bash
pio device monitor
```

## Libraries

- **ltc230x**: For Analog to Digital Converter control
- **encoder @^1.4.0**: For Rotary encoder handling
- **freqcount@^1.0.0**: For frequency Counter functionality
- **adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library@^1.10.13**: For core graphics for display
- **adafruit/Adafruit SSD1306@^2.5.0**: For Monochrome OLEDs based on SSD1306 drivers
- **ArduinoJson@^6.21.5**: For sending the measured data as JSON format

## Testing

To run tests, use:

```bash
pio test
```

**Note**: There is currently no test available

## Troubleshooting

Include common issues and solutions:

- **Compilation Errors**: Ensure all libraries are properly declared in `platformio.ini`.
- **Upload Failures**: Verify connection and correct port settings.
