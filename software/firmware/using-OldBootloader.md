To configure PlatformIO for uploading to an Arduino Nano with an ATmega328 microcontroller using the old bootloader, you need to specify the correct upload parameters in your `platformio.ini` file. Here's how you can set it up:

```ini
[env:nanoatmega328]
platform = atmelavr
board = nanoatmega328
framework = arduino
upload_protocol = arduino
upload_speed = 57600
```

### Explanation:
- **platform**: Specifies the platform to be used; in this case, it's `atmelavr`.
- **board**: Refers to the board type; use `nanoatmega328` for the Arduino Nano with an ATmega328 microcontroller.
- **framework**: Indicates the framework you want to use, which is `arduino` here.
- **upload_protocol**: Sets the protocol for uploading; `arduino` is typically used for FTDI/USB-based uploads.
- **upload_speed**: Defines the baud rate for uploading sketches. The old bootloader for the Arduino Nano typically uses a speed of `57600`.

Make sure your serial port settings are correct, especially if you're uploading from a specific COM port. You can specify it explicitly by adding something like:

```ini
upload_port = /dev/ttyUSB0  ; or COM3 on Windows
```

Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `COM3` with the actual port your Arduino Nano is connected to. This configuration should help you successfully upload code to your Arduino Nano using the old bootloader.
